		You say “hi” and he greets you back, however, he doesn’t seem to be in the mood to talk to you. It comes to your mind that he might be a little

		What could you do to make up for it?</content>
		<option href="l125e051">When I see him again, I'll apologize for my behavior and explain to him that I didn’t think about the effects it could have,

		<option href="l180e003">Maria and Fernando already got their dish as well, despite the service being really slow. When they start eating without waiting for the rest, I start eating, too. 
		Having finished, I realize that a piece of food is stuck between my teeth, so I take the toothpick with the one hand, covering my mouth with the other one and start removing it.</option>

Beijing Opera is the most significant of all operas in China, and it has a richness of repertoire, great number of artists and audiences, that give it a profound influence in China and plays a large role in Chinese culture.
		Beijing Opera is a synthesis of stylized action, singing, dialogue and mime, acrobatic fighting and dancing to represent a story or depict different characters and their feelings of gladness, anger, sorrow, happiness, surprise, fear and sadness.
		The characters may be loyal or treacherous, beautiful or ugly, good or bad, their images being vividly manifested.
		The story of the following Beijing opera is about a married couple. But the wife has an affair with a monk.
		Her husband finds out about it. Therefore his servant kills the monk to protect his masters marriage.
		However he gets so furious that he brings his wife to the mountain "Cui Wei Shan" where he plans to kill her.
		In the following scene, where she is begging for forgiveness, you may recognise her black hair decoration which is an indication for her soon coming death.

		Please don’t think that the waiter is impolite or that you did something rude.

		Suddenly the waiter starts to stutter in Chinese and everyone in the room seems to be nervous and discussing in Chinese. The waiter runs out of the room and comes back in still discussing.
		At the end the project manager apologizes that this restaurant has no fork and knife because they don’t have foreign guests very often.</content>

		As you may know, it is common in China that all of the attendees of a meal pick by themselves what they want to eat out of all the bowls that are on the table.
		It is not as in a Western culture that everyone has their own plate. Chinese people prefer warm dishes and warm drinks such as tea or just boiled water. You use chopsticks and a spoon to eat. It seems impolite to eat until everything on the table is empty.
		In this case, Chinese people will assume that you are still hungry and will order more.</message>

		This is a possible way to say goodbye to someone. Even if shaking hands is not a traditional way most Chinese business men are used to this western greeting. To show more respect and your pleasure about the outcome of your visit it would have been better to express your pleasure by just smiling and tell them in a polite way that you are satisfied.</message>

		You are right, in China physical contact between business men is uncommon.
		Your colleagues will definitely feel unpleasant. By using the Chinese term for goodbye and smiling you show the most respect for your partners.
		Because the project manager is at a higher position and older than you are he needs to choose if he would like to thank you or say goodbye by reaching a hand.</message>

		As you may know, it is common in China that all of the attendees of a meal pick by themselves what they want to eat out of all the bowls that are on the table.
		It is not as in a Western culture that everyone has their own plate. Chinese people prefer warm dishes and warm drinks such as tea or just boiled water. You use chopsticks and a spoon to eat. It seems impolite to eat until everything on the table is empty.
		In this case, Chinese people will assume that you are still hungry and will order more.</message>

		This is a possible way to say goodbye to someone. Even if shaking hands is not a traditional way most Chinese business men are used to this western greeting.

		You are right, in China physical contact between business men is uncommon.
		Your colleagues will definitely feel unpleasant. By using the Chinese term for goodbye and smiling you show the most respect for your partners.
		Because the project manager is at a higher position and older than you are he needs to choose if he would like to thank you or say goodbye by reaching a hand.</message>

     At the end you arrive at the hotel. You are slightly surprised as the hotel is not empty but quite crowded. As a foreigner you get almost immediately the attention of everybody
     in the courtyard and they approach. All of them are talking to you getting closer until they are even touching your arm or your shoulder.

   Because of a planned meeting with a customer you are under pressure. Like in the meetings before the room is not prepared ten minutes before the meeting.
   This time even drinks for the participants are missing. Because of the fact that the meeting will take a few hours some drinks would be appreciated. You prepare your presentation 
   ands ask a colleague to fetch you some drinks.

    <option href="l635e101">Employees in India are not used to being ordered around. The employee feels bullied around and therefore he does not want to give in.</option>

    <option href="l635e104"> Women in India that work for international companies are typically very emancipated. Therefore the employee does the task without hesitation.</option>

  A reaction like this is absolutely imaginable. But many times the typical Indian man interprets this as flirting. 
  This is not beneficial for the future development.

 <message> 
  In India it is not typical for a woman to call a man after a common dinner. The majority of the male population would interpret it differently
  than it was intended to be.

The values of the Globe Study illustrate this assumption. The Power Distance in India is high. Therefore a meeting with the team and their boss
is rare. On top of that the value in In-Group-Collectivism is high meaning that it takes a longer period of time for an individual to become a 
part of a certain group.

    <title>Farmers Market in Rural Area</title>
    <content>  
    After a long day in the office you go back to your hotel and dress up. Afterwards you go to a farmers market in a rural area. 
    You want to escape your daily business life for some time. You realise that the people around you stare at you critically. But why?
    </content>
      
    <option href="l665e101">In comparison to the city, in rural areas it is unusual that women do the groceries. In the rural area it is a man's business. The woman 
    stays at home and takes care of the household.</option>
      
    <option href="l665e102">Because of the expensive clothes you are wearing the people are confused. "Why is a wealthy woman doing the shopping on her own?" In the Indian
    middle class it is usual to have a servant doing the shopping for you.</option>

  In India there are big social differences. The field of activity of a woman depends whether the woman´s family is wealthy or not and whether they
  live in a rural or urban part of India. Nevertheless daily chores are definitely in the field of activity of women.

        %prename% will be responsible for the whole client communication for the HQ while I will be representing our sales office here in Stockholm.

       <messageBoxA>Despite Swedish colleagues work together very closely, they separate business and

        <messageBoxA>Reconsider your decision. Keep the flat hierarchy in mind. You should rather involve your team 
		directly in decision making or at least inform them about the latest decisions. Besides that Swedes are more 
		comfortable with start working instead of “wasting time” with planning. Also most of the Swedish population stops 
		working for a few weeks in midsummer to take holidays. Because of this not only your team will be understaffed during

        as all of you know, our sales department here in Stockholm was established not very long ago. But nevertheless our German general management says that it cannot be seen as an excuse for our bad figures.
        In the upcoming months there are many business fairs where we need to develop new business contacts. This is where our new German colleague fits in the story:
        %prename% will be responsible for the whole client communication for the HQ while I will be representing our sales office here in Stockholm.
        Now it's up to you, %prename%!

        Remember: Sweden do not like conflicts, they enjoy democracy and do not like to interrupt people. They are honest but not rude.
        You need to take into consideration that Sweden like to do formal agreements.
        More over, flat hierarchies and openness are lived in Sweden.

       <messageBoxA>Despite Swedish colleagues work together very closely, they separate business and
	   private life strictly. When you invite them to a private occasion, don’t
	   expect them to come. They will probably refuse gently. When it comes to
	   neighbors, Swedes are very conservative. They say during the first year,
	   Swedish neighbors greet each other over the fence. During the second year,
	   they talk about the weather and from the third year on they invite each to
	   their home. </messageBoxA>

        <messageBoxA>Reconsider your decision. Keep the flat hierarchy in mind. You should rather involve your team

		<messageBoxA> Thanks %prename%, let’s start. The project is set for 9 months 
		and we are starting a new online marketing strategy. With you, %prename%,
		 we are 7 team members and all are assigned full-time for this period of time.
		 Since it’s about individual marketing strategies we work both, in teams 
		 and on our own to get the most out of it. Once there’s a strategy we 
		 better test it on our customers since it’s their reaction we need to 
		 consider. Those innovative theories better get tested as soon as possible
		  before the competition will know about it. Our customers think we are 
		  the most innovative company and we want to keep it that way. 
		  Now back to you, %prename%!

		<messageBoxA>Aang, the guy you met before, should present a quick progress of the project 
		in yesterday’s morning meeting. The meeting was scheduled for 15 minutes, he 
		filled in some of that time but not with those information I needed. I thought 
		that was clear enough. He said let’s find some ideas and test them straight 
		with our customers. I mean why? They don’t even want to test them first, they 
		just want the customers to know we are the most innovative company. And I 
		missed a lot of other information like who should communicate to whom? And 
		what are the company rules? I mean he didn’t even tell one of the rules. I 
		said I want to get those information but later, since the whole team doesn’t 
		need to be there for that. I just don’t get it! How am I supposed to lead 
		such team so independent and on their own without lots of rules?</messageBoxA>
		<messageBoxB href="l410e012">Same happened to me when I was abroad. You better talk to 
		Aang in private and set things straight. Tell him in specific which kind 
		of information you need to know. And don’t forget they are just setting 
		different focuses. Their focus is set on quick results and solutions 
		instead of the problems itself and who’s responsible for that. If that’s 
		not possible, please let me know, then I'll talk to the team in America. 
		Americans just do it differently; it’s nothing personal so please take 
		that in mind! Thank you for the update. This project has top priority 
		and has to work; we have a high cost pressure! Is there anything else?

		<messageBoxA>I’m good, thanks. Yes, that’s why I’m calling but unfortunately

		<messageBoxA>Aang, the guy you met before, should present a quick progress of the project 
		in yesterday’s morning meeting. The meeting was scheduled for 15 minutes, he 
		filled in some of that time but not with those information I needed. I thought 
		that was clear enough. He said let’s find some ideas and test them straight 
		with our customers. I mean why? They don’t even want to test them first, they 
		just want the customers to know we are the most innovative company. And I 
		missed a lot of other information like who should communicate to whom? And 
		what are the company rules? I mean he didn’t even tell one of the rules. I 
		said I want to get those information but later, since the whole team doesn’t 
		need to be there for that. I just don’t get it! How am I supposed to lead 
		such team so independent and on their own without lots of rules?</messageBoxA>
		<messageBoxB href="l460e012">Same happened to me when I was abroad. You better talk to 
		Aang in private and set things straight. Tell him in specific which kind 
		of information you need to know. And don’t forget they are just setting 
		different focuses. Their focus is set on quick results and solutions 
		instead of the problems itself and who’s responsible for that. If that’s 
		not possible, please let me know, then I'll talk to the team in America. 
		Americans just do it differently; it’s nothing personal so please take 
		that in mind! Thank you for the update. This project has top priority 
		and has to work; we have a high cost pressure! Is there anything else?
